# Welcome, it’s a pleasure to have you here.

My name is Vinicius Pimenta, and I’m 25 years old. My interest in technology, specifically programming, began in 2011. For several years, I played a lot of a popular game called Minecraft. Since I played on servers, I was always curious to understand how server plugins worked and whether I could create modifications to test with friends and have fun. However, over time, I let that old passion fade away and eventually stopped altogether. But in 2024, I came back stronger than ever! I dropped out of my International Relations degree, enrolled in a Systems Analysis and Development program, and restarted my journey in the tech field. This time, I’m more determined and eager to make up for lost time and rise in the tech industry—something I never should have left in the first place.
